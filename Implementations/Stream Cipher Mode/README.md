Stream cipher is way of encrypting the data in which the data is first converted into bits and then the bit is converted to cipher using (bit+key)%2 or XOR where key is some bit. For example, to encrypt letter 'A', convert into ASCII which is 65, convert 65 into bits and perform bitwise XOR. The result is obtained by XORing again the cipher. The point here is how to make key as random as possible such that it becomes difficult to check using brute force attack. We should use Cryptographically secure Pseudo Random number generators. In other words, Kolmogorov complexity should be high.  It is used in GSM mobile communication.
